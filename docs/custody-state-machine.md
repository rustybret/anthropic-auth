# Custody state machine: global `claustrum` | `local` mode with main-account takeover

Design record for PR #196 (rework). This file is the artefact that gates implementation of the
mode transition; the PR comment stream (Rev 1, Rev 2, three addenda) is superseded by it. The
reasoning is kept in-tree because a diff will not carry it and every row here was paid for by a
ruling or an incident.

Status: **implementation baseline** (maintainer, 2026-09-05 06:04Z, PR #196). This document is the
baseline for the implementation pass; the maintainer reviews the result and owns final integration
and remaining corrections. The go-ahead is permission to build, **not** approval to merge or to
activate takeover against live credentials; no live migration or release is authorised by it. Three
constraints bind the implementation (§13). The branch still carries the superseded per-account
toggle, which will not be merged as-is.

## 1. Scope and vocabulary

Two global modes, persisted in `anthropic-auth.json`:

- `local` (default): the plugin refreshes and serves OAuth credentials from OpenCode's `auth.json`
  (main) and its own sidecar (fallbacks). No vault calls are made in this mode.
- `claustrum`: every OAuth route, **main included**, is served from the Claustrum vault through a
  handle-manifest binding. The vault is the sole refresher of every bound family.

Commands are exactly `/claude-account claustrum`, `/claude-account local`, and bare
`/claude-account` for status. There is no per-account custody toggle, no `claustrum.enabled`
flag, and no `on|off` synonym. Account membership is decided by the handle manifest, not by
configuration. API-key routes are out of scope and unaffected in both modes.

**Mode records intent; credential state proves servability.** `mode=claustrum` licenses the
takeover barrier and the custody serving path. It never by itself makes an account servable, and
a per-account verdict never by itself changes the mode.

## 2. The tombstone: one write set, one classifier, one wider refusal

Main's slot in `auth.json` cannot be empty: OpenCode runs a plugin's `auth.loader` only when a
stored entry exists (`provider/provider.ts:1604-1619`, `if (!stored) continue`), and an entry
that fails the `Info` decode is silently filtered by `Auth.all()` (`auth/index.ts:56-67`). An
absent or malformed slot therefore means **our request path does not exist**: no loader, no fetch
hook, no custody. Under `claustrum` the slot holds a non-secret tombstone whose only job is to
make the loader run.

### 2.1 WRITE set (production writes exactly this, nothing else)

```json
{ "type": "oauth", "access": "", "refresh": "claustrum-tombstone:v1:anthropic", "expires": 0 }
```

`access` is **empty**, and that is load-bearing, not cosmetic. OpenCode's `Info` schema is
`access: Schema.String` with no non-empty constraint, so the slot decodes and the loader runs
(verified live on 1.18.26 by the maintainer, reproduced on `openai`). Claustrum's deployed sealer
runs a shape gate that **aborts on empty access but accepts sentinel access**; an empty-access
tombstone therefore fails vault import by construction, independently of Claustrum's
reserved-prefix refusal (#28). Anything that later "tidies" this to carry a descriptive `access`
value silently re-arms the destructive import path. The constant carries this comment.

### 2.2 RECOGNISE (classifier: "is this MY provider's tombstone?")

```
auth.type === 'oauth' && auth.refresh === custodyTombstoneKey(provider)
```

`access` and `expires` are **not** conjuncts. Once the exact provider-scoped sentinel is present in
`refresh`, a different `access`/`expires` is a partial write or corrupt state that must still enter
the custody path, never approach local refresh. Every extra conjunct is another way to *miss*, and a
miss falls through to a wrong-state boot: the loader does not refuse, `mainAccountId` is minted,
quota-identity resolution runs its compat substitution, and the background refresh loop starts
before the exchange-level guard finally throws. A spurious match merely refuses to serve.

Both artefact shapes are pinned by tests: the empty-access shape production writes, and the
sentinel-access shape Claustrum's vendored golden encodes (legacy). A golden-only test is green
about a shape production never writes.

### 2.3 REFUSE (barrier: "is this tombstone material at all?")

Prefix-wide, at the last point before the irreversible act, on the **value committed** rather than
the record it came from:

- token exchange: `assertNotCustodyTombstone` is the first statement of `refreshClaudeOAuthToken`,
  keyed on `refresh.startsWith(CUSTODY_TOMBSTONE_PREFIX)`, before any `URLSearchParams` is built;
- send boundary: the bearer value is checked for the prefix before header construction.

These deliberately do **not** share a predicate with §2.2. Recognition is exact so a foreign
provider's tombstone is not adopted as ours; refusal is wide so a foreign provider's tombstone can
never reach Anthropic's token endpoint. Two reviewers on two plugins independently reached to merge
them in one afternoon; the merge would have narrowed the barrier to the classifier, which is the
same failure as having no barrier.

**Containment invariant, pinned by one test:** `refusal ⊋ recognition`. Every shape recognised at
the loader is refused at the exchange and the send boundary; the witness for strictness is a
**foreign-provider** tombstone (`claustrum-tombstone:v1:openai`), which recognition answers *no*
and refusal answers *yes*. A same-provider witness cannot distinguish the two predicates and so
cannot protect the split.

## 3. Axes

Evaluated independently for main and for **each enabled OAuth fallback**.

| axis | values | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `mode` | `local` · `claustrum` | global, durable; the only global write in the barrier |
| `binding` | `VALID` · `INVALID` · `ABSENT` | the account's entry `{label, handle, credentialId}` in our provider block of the shared handle manifest. `INVALID` = entry present, handle or credentialId fails validation. `VALID` = a RESOLVED binding from the resolver, whichever source it came from: a manifest entry, or (transitionally, for the migration window and the crash-left / unreadable-manifest case) a plugin-written sidecar handle. Source is provenance, not authorization; the resolver owns the binding decision and startup migration converges sidecar handles into the manifest. What membership-by-manifest retires is the per-account *config flag* as an authority, not sidecar-held bindings. |
| `local` | `REAL` · `INERT` · `GONE` | main: `REAL` = usable material, `INERT` = recognise-set tombstone, `GONE` = slot absent **as observed through the SDK**. An unparseable main slot is unobservable: `Auth.all()` runs `Record.filterMap(decode)` (`auth/index.ts:65-66`), so a slot failing the `Info` schema reads as `undefined` and any later host write rewrites the file without it; for main, `GONE ≡ SLOT_ABSENT`. Fallback: `REAL` = usable refresh material, `INERT` = refresh material absent, row otherwise valid, `GONE` = `ROW_UNPARSEABLE` (our own store, so the distinction survives there; a row that is *absent* while a binding exists is the discovery operation, §7, not a coordinate) |
| `vault` | `USABLE` · `COLD` · `REAUTH` · `N/A` | resolved through the binding's handle. `COLD` = daemon unreachable or credential not resident (transient). `REAUTH` = record latched `needs_reauth`. `N/A` ⇔ `binding ∈ {ABSENT, INVALID}` |

The startup matrix in §5 uses a compact four-letter form: `mode|main|fallbacks|evidence`.

| letter | meaning |
|---|---|
| `C` | global `claustrum` mode |
| `L` | global `local` mode |
| `R` | real local OAuth material is present |
| `T` | local material is tombstoned or absent while a binding resolves |
| `X` | the main host slot is absent or cannot be observed as a valid OAuth slot |
| `M` | a fallback binding is missing |
| `V` | main vault evidence is verified at startup |
| `N` | main vault evidence is not verified at startup |

Two facts about `GONE` for main, both from OpenCode source (`339536bc22`), change what it means:

- an absent slot never reaches `auth.loader`, so any reconciliation that must observe main's slot
  before the loader runs lives in the **plugin factory**, which is invoked during the first
  Provider-state construction via `plugin.list()` (`provider.ts:1436`) but **before** the provider
  reaches `auth.all()` and the loader pass (`:1591-1622`). An awaited write from the factory would be
  visible to the first loader; the plugin currently issues no such write (§5, C9).
- today `normalizeAccount` null-drops an unparseable fallback row and `Auth.all()` hides an absent
  or malformed slot. Reconciliation reads **raw** rows and slots so `GONE` is surfaced, and a `GONE`
  fallback's state secrets are **retained**, never pruned, never normalised into success.

## 4. Fences (three, never combined)

| fence | compares | when | effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RECORD_VERSION** | the `record_version` captured from the resolution that served *this* request's token, passed unchanged to `report_auth_failure` for *this* response | per request, on a 401 | provenance only. **Never** a startup coordinate, never affects availability. `record_version` is `expected_version + 1` on every vault `commit_refresh` (`store.rs:1931-1951`); an earlier draft that compared it at startup would have made an account unavailable every time the vault did its job |
| **IDENTITY** | vault `account_id` from `credential.get` **vs** the row's persisted `anthropicAccountUuid` | startup reconcile and each custody tick, only when `vault=USABLE` | **both present and unequal → `MISMATCH`** (refuse serve, no writes, surfaced). **Either absent → `UNLABELLED`**: serve; absence is not difference. The request-time bootstrap of the served token performs the same comparison per request and is the authoritative one (§4.1) |
| **PRE-COMMIT FINGERPRINT** | `sha256(len(access) ‖ access ‖ len(refresh) ‖ refresh)` of each account's local material as read inside the barrier's fences | persisted with the mode write; consulted by `RESUME_TAKEOVER` | **crash reconciliation only.** Distinguishes crash-left pre-commit material (fingerprint matches → resume) from material that changed after the barrier read (differs → `NEW_LOCAL_FAMILY_UNDER_CLAUSTRUM`, §5), because content alone cannot tell the two apart and the in-process login record does not survive the restart that the crash case is. **It does not make the host write safe** (§12.1): OpenCode's `Auth.set` sits outside every lock we hold, and a re-read immediately before `client.auth.set` is still check-then-write |

`credentialId` is **not** a startup comparand: `credential.get` returns `payload`, `expires_at_ms`,
`record_version`, `project_id?`, `account_id?`, `email?`, `org_name?` and **no credential id**
(`claustrum/crates/credentials-module/src/read_surface.rs:272-303`; the Rust source states
`account_id` is neither the credential id nor the handle). `credentialId` is the join key for the
quota feed and operator tooling only.

### 4.1 Identity provenance (Anthropic-specific; a port must not copy it)

On the vault side `account_id = account_id_for_adapter(adapter, token).or_else(stored identity)`
(`read_surface.rs:849-858`), and the live parse derives only for `openai`. For Anthropic the vault's
`account_id` is therefore the **operator-asserted** `ck auth set-identity` label, while our
request-time bootstrap of the served token is **provider-asserted**. The startup IDENTITY check
catches a swapped or mislabelled record; only the request-time check catches a label that is itself
wrong. Both yield `MISMATCH`; the request-time one is authoritative. For OpenAI the precedence
inverts (token claim wins; the vault's write sink refuses a contradicting label).

Fingerprint covers both tokens, length-prefixed. Between the barrier's read and its commit, local
refresh is inert (binding), OpenCode has no Anthropic refresh loop, Anthropic never rotates access
without refresh, and a host login writes a whole new family; so refresh-only and both-tokens are
equivalent in the true-positive direction. They differ on a torn `Auth.set` (new access, old
refresh): both-tokens refuses, refresh-only tombstones an access token that is dead without its
family. Same safety; both-tokens removes an assumption about the atomicity of a file we do not own.

## 5. `mode = claustrum`

Per account. `serve` is from the vault where it says `vault`; local material is **never** served in
this mode. Local refresh is inert wherever a binding exists (`VALID` or `INVALID`), independent of
vault reachability: a valid binding means the vault owns that family, and a cold daemon is not
evidence to the contrary. A corrupt binding must not silently re-enable a local refresher on a
vault-owned family.

| # | binding | local | vault | verdict | serve | local refresh | durable writes | retry | operator |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | VALID | INERT | USABLE | `CUSTODY_SERVE` | vault | inert | none | — | none |
| C2 | VALID | REAL, fingerprint **matches** | USABLE | fallback: `RESUME_TAKEOVER` · main: `TAKEOVER_INCOMPLETE_MAIN_REAL` (§13.1) | fallback: vault, after its commit · main: **no** | inert | fallback → drop refresh material under its lock · main → **none** | fallback: immediate · main: none | main: onboard into the vault with Claustrum's tooling |
| C2′ | VALID | REAL, fingerprint **differs or absent** | any | `NEW_LOCAL_FAMILY_UNDER_CLAUSTRUM` (for main under §13.1 this is the *classification* of the `TAKEOVER_INCOMPLETE_MAIN_REAL` refusal: material the barrier did not read, versus C2's crash-left material it did) | **no** | inert | **none** | none | **unresolved** (§12.2): vault import with Claustrum's tooling, then re-enter, is consistent with every rule; "exit to `local` and the login stands" is not |
| C3 | VALID | INERT | COLD | `CUSTODY_UNAVAILABLE` | **no** (typed provider-unavailable) | inert | none | bounded custody retry on vault availability | none |
| C3′ | VALID | REAL | COLD | `TAKEOVER_INCOMPLETE_VAULT_UNAVAILABLE` | **no** | inert | **none**: no rollback, no drop. The destructive commit waits for `USABLE` (→ C2) because dropping material without proof the vault holds the family is destruction without evidence | on vault availability | none required; `local` + re-login only to abandon custody |
| C4 | VALID | any | REAUTH | `CUSTODY_CREDENTIAL_LATCHED` | **no** | inert | none | **none**: retry cannot fix a latched record | re-import into the vault; resumes without a mode change |
| C5 | VALID | any | USABLE ∧ IDENTITY mismatch | `CUSTODY_IDENTITY_MISMATCH` | **no** | inert | none | none | `set-identity` or re-bind; a different account may sit behind this handle |
| C6 | ABSENT | REAL | N/A | `NOT_ENROLLED` | **no** | **no** (this mode has no local refreshers) | none | none | `ck auth bind` after import, or `local` |
| C7 | ABSENT | INERT | N/A | `ORPHAN_TOMBSTONE` (main) / `ORPHAN_INERT` (fallback) | **no** | nothing to refresh | none | none | `bind`, or `local` + re-login |
| C8 | INVALID | any | N/A | `CORRUPT_BINDING` | **no** | **inert** | **none**: never auto-repair a manifest entry | none | `ck auth bind --replace`, or `local` |
| C9 | VALID | GONE (main) | USABLE · COLD · REAUTH | `TAKEOVER_INCOMPLETE_SLOT_ABSENT` | **no** | inert | **none** (plugin-side install into an absent slot is **withdrawn**, see below) | next boot | vault import restores the slot; or the host, once a fenced write exists |
| C10 | VALID | GONE (fallback = `ROW_UNPARSEABLE`) | any | `CORRUPT_ROW` | **no** | inert | **none**; state secrets retained | next reconcile | repair the row, or remove + re-discover |

At the loader, `evidence` means the main-slot vault evidence only. Fallback residency is route-local: a cold bound fallback is excluded for that request while other routes, including a resident main, continue to serve. Structural fallback dimensions (`R`/`M`) still produce `RESUME_TAKEOVER` or a binding-missing refusal independently of loader evidence.

Invariants pinning the combinations not rowed:

- `vault = N/A ⇔ binding ∈ {ABSENT, INVALID}`; a `VALID` binding always resolves to one of
  `USABLE | COLD | REAUTH`. Test: every `VALID` fixture produces a connector call; no `ABSENT`/`INVALID`
  fixture does.
- `binding = ABSENT ∧ local = GONE` for main is not a custody state: with no binding there is nothing
  to restore, so the slot stays as found and OpenCode's own not-logged-in applies (no install without
  a binding: that would fabricate custody).
- The recognise-set (§2.2) makes "partial tombstone write" a tombstone for every verdict; there is
  no separate local-axis value for it.
- **C9 no longer installs.** An earlier revision restored the tombstone into an absent slot so the
  loader would run and a typed verdict could exist. That write is withdrawn: with no lock, no CAS, a
  non-atomic host write, and the torn-read amplifier (§12.1), an install into an "absent" slot is
  the highest-blast-radius write this plugin could issue (it can wipe every provider's credentials),
  and its payoff was a typed verdict in place of the host's generic not-logged-in. The absent slot is
  named in status and restored by vault import or by the host once a fenced write lands
  (#46128). Two rules bind **any** host-slot write the plugin ever issues: (1) read
  `client.auth.all()` first and, if it is EMPTY, abort the write, warn once, retry next tick, since an
  empty map on a machine with any configured provider is a torn read until proven otherwise; (2)
  treat a slot as absent only after two reads at least 250 ms apart, both `undefined`, both with a
  NON-EMPTY `all()`. The install-on-`MISMATCH` divergence from the openai-auth port (§10) is moot
  while no install exists.

## 6. `mode = local`

No vault call is made in this mode (test: zero connector invocations under `mode=local`). The
`vault` axis is not consulted.

| # | binding | local | verdict | serve | local refresh | durable writes | operator |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | ABSENT | REAL | `LOCAL_SERVE` | local | yes | none | none |
| L2 | ABSENT | GONE | `DARK_PENDING_LOGIN` | no | no | none | `/login` |
| L3 | ABSENT | INERT | `AWAITING_LOGIN` | no | nothing to refresh | none | `/login`. **Expected**: this is the post-`/claude-account local` state before re-login |
| L4 | VALID | INERT · GONE | `AWAITING_LOGIN` with a lingering binding (exit ran; the clear did not land or was never reached) | no | inert (binding) | none | `/login`; the verified login clears the binding (§7) |
| L5 | VALID | REAL | `DARK_PENDING_VERIFIED_LOGIN` | **no** | inert (binding) | none | `/login` through our own path |
| L6 | INVALID | any | `CORRUPT_BINDING` | no | **no** | none | repair or remove the entry |

**L5 is the row the verified-login ruling creates.** Real material alongside a live binding means
material appeared without a login through our path: a restored backup, a hand-edit, a copied file.
"Material exists" is satisfiable by a restore and so cannot be the clearing signal; the binding keeps
refresh inert and the account stays dark until a real login clears it.

## 7. The takeover barrier (`/claude-account claustrum`)

An **all-accounts readiness barrier**, not an atomic commit: the writes span the sidecar and shared
manifest and cannot be made kill-atomic. Every completed intermediate write is fail-closed and
idempotent, giving a crashed or failed transition a direct resume path without destructive rollback.

0. Acquire, in this fixed total order: config write lock → cross-tenant manifest lock → per-account
   refresh locks (main, then fallbacks by sorted id). Hold all through final readback. Deadlock-free
   by total order; lock TTLs are renewed while held.
1. **Inside** the locks, re-read the manifest, fallback rows, and main auth slot. Recompute each
   account's local-material fingerprint. A changed real credential refuses before any write. An
   already tombstoned fallback is accepted as a completed transition step rather than mistaken for
   missing local material.
2. Verify every enabled OAuth account has a valid binding and a usable vault credential. Main must
   already hold the recognise-set tombstone (§13.1); the plugin never writes `auth.json`. Any
   readiness failure releases the locks with zero new writes and names the first failing account.
3. Persist any validated legacy fallback binding into the manifest, then tombstone each fallback
   row. Both operations are idempotent. A failure leaves completed steps in place and keeps the
   mode local; live bindings make those partial rows dark, so no local refresh authority is regained.
4. Re-read the target state and vault credentials. Only after every account verifies does the
   command persist `mode=claustrum` (**mode last**), then perform a final committed readback.
5. If final readback fails after this invocation changed the mode, revert only the mode to `local`.
   Never restore raw config, state, or manifest snapshots: a whole-file restore can erase a login,
   account addition, or another tenant's manifest update that committed concurrently. If mode
   reversion itself fails, leave Claustrum mode fail-closed and surface explicit recovery guidance.
   Re-running the command resumes from the tombstoned rows and existing bindings.

Against other processes, enable/disable and plugin-owned login paths take the config lock;
manifest writes take the cross-tenant lock; and refreshes take the corresponding refresh lock. The
host's `Auth.set` serialises with nothing we hold, which is why main tombstone installation remains
an external precondition rather than a plugin write (§12.1).

Serving is per-account after a committed transition: a late-cold main returns a typed retryable
refusal while a healthy fallback can remain route-local. No request may fall through from a bound
account to tombstone or local secret material.

Serving is per-account and independent of the barrier: main may serve from the vault while a
fallback sits in C3, and the reverse. Nothing about serving account A depends on account B, so no
aggregate state exists.

## 8. Operation transitions

| operation | mode | precondition | effect | fence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/claude-account claustrum` | local | barrier §7 | mode + fingerprints, then per-account commits | §7 |
| `/claude-account local` | claustrum | — | `mode=local` only. **No material writes, no manifest writes.** Bindings stay; every bound account becomes L4/L5 and stays dark until a verified login clears it. A transient inability to prove vault state never transfers refresh authority back to local; abandoning custody is this explicit command plus re-login | config lock |
| local login (`Claude Pro/Max` authorize) | claustrum | — | **refused before the browser opens or anything is written**: `Exit Claustrum mode first: /claude-account local` | none needed |
| verified login | local | login completed through **our** OAuth path (in-process record) **∧** real material observed via the live `getAuth` re-read | commit the new family, **then** clear that account's binding, both under config + manifest locks in one fence; bump the generation → L1 | config + manifest locks |
| enable account | claustrum | binding VALID ∧ vault USABLE ∧ IDENTITY not mismatched (COLD is a typed refusal, not a wait) | `enabled=true` | config lock |
| enable account | local | — | `enabled=true` | config lock |
| disable | any | — | `enabled=false`; binding unchanged; vault material untouched | config lock |
| remove account | claustrum | — | row removed; **its** binding removed under the manifest lock; vault material **retained** (`ck auth` owns vault removal; the plugin never writes the vault) | config + manifest locks |
| add new OAuth account | claustrum | vault-side tooling created the credential **and** the binding in our provider block | reconcile **discovers** a VALID binding with no row → creates `{id: label, enabled: false, no refresh material, no identity}`, appended to the fallback order. INERT from birth: there is never a moment where a row exists, is enabled, and lacks a usable vault binding. **Discovery writes no identity**; the row binds `anthropicAccountUuid` from the first served token's bootstrap, never from the vault's operator-asserted label and never from a placeholder (a placeholder would `MISMATCH` the real claim forever) | config lock, manifest re-read inside it |
| manifest change (other tenant) racing the barrier | — | — | serialised by the cross-tenant lock; if it lands between steps 1 and 4 → generation bump → that account's commit aborts → resume | manifest lock + generation |
| enable/disable racing the barrier | — | — | serialised by the config lock | config lock |

**Adding a new account today.** No verb on Claustrum master writes our provider block
(`mint-handle` prints a handle; `migrate-opencode` writes an OpenCode-shaped entry even under
`--serve-by anthropic-auth`; Claustrum's follow-up plugin tooling writes our block but takes a
plugin-**exported** file, so it migrates accounts we already hold). Two paths:

- direct, once it lands: `ck auth bind --serve anthropic-auth --label <label> --id <credential_id>`
  (scoped on the Claustrum side): mint → verify the handle resolves → write `{label, handle,
  credential_id}` under the cross-tenant lock → verify → **revoke the handle on any failure after
  mint**. Refuses an existing label without `--replace`; refuses a credential id outside the tenant's
  allowed prefix; never touches our account rows. Chosen over a plugin-side verb because a handle
  must never sit at rest between two commands when one can mint-and-persist with revoke-on-failure.
- interim (every step exists): `/claude-account local` → `/login` → vault import with
  Claustrum's tooling → `/claude-account claustrum`.

**Exit-edge dependency.** The verified-login clear requires the manifest writer (Slice 2,
`feat/custody-manifest`), which lands before this transition. It is plugin-side in the same phase.

**`OPENCODE_AUTH_CONTENT`.** `Auth.all()` short-circuits to that env payload when set, so the live
`getAuth` re-read can never observe a re-login and the binding would never clear: the exact
dark-account loop the exit edge exists to prevent. Reconciliation detects the variable and fails
loudly rather than degrading into it.

## 9. Verified facts this design rests on

| fact | source |
|---|---|
| `auth.loader` runs only for a stored slot; decode failures are filtered before it | OpenCode `339536bc22`: `provider/provider.ts:1604-1619`, `auth/index.ts:14-21, 56-67` |
| plugin factories run during first Provider-state construction, before the loader pass | `provider.ts:1396-1438, 1591-1622`, `plugin/index.ts:170-242` |
| login does **not** re-invoke `auth.loader`; `Auth.set` writes `auth.json` and emits nothing | `provider/auth.ts:188-221`, `auth/index.ts:73-80` |
| the `getAuth` handed to the loader is live: `get → all()` re-reads `auth.json` per call | `auth/index.ts:58-71` |
| `access: ""` decodes; the loader runs; the request reaches our fetch | maintainer probe on 1.18.26; `Info` schema `access: Schema.String` |
| Claustrum's deployed sealer aborts on empty access, accepts sentinel access | Claustrum, `digest()` run against all three shapes |
| #28 reserved-prefix refusal covers the OpenCode import entrance, **not** the write sink (`put --replace` still accepts a tombstone) | Claustrum master `decab7f`; sink guard is a follow-up |
| `credential.get` returns no credential id; `account_id` is neither credential id nor handle | `read_surface.rs:272-303` |
| `account_id` for Anthropic is the stored `set-identity` label (live parse derives only for `openai`) | `read_surface.rs:849-858`, `oauth_login.rs:533` |
| `record_version` advances on every `commit_refresh` | `store.rs:1931-1951`, `engine_tests.rs:418-427` |
| no Claustrum master verb writes our provider block | Claustrum master `decab7f`: `opencode_migration.rs:232, 628` |

## 10. Deliberate divergences from the openai-auth port

Both plugins hold the same contract (write set, recognise/refuse split, fences, barrier shape,
transition table). These differ on purpose and are stated so neither is read as an oversight:

1. ~~Install on `MISMATCH` for a GONE main slot~~ — moot: both ports have withdrawn plugin-side
   install into an absent slot (§5 invariants, §12.1). Converged.
2. **Fallback artefact under custody**: fallback rows use the same empty-access, provider-scoped
   refresh tombstone as main. Recognition keys on the exact refresh sentinel, while the wider send
   and refresh barriers reject every reserved-prefix value. This keeps partially completed and
   repeated transitions observable and idempotent without putting a truthy sentinel in `access`.
3. **Identity provenance** (§4.1): operator-asserted at the vault for us, provider-asserted for them.

## 11. Open items (external)

- Maintainer approval of §5–§8 (gates implementation of the transition).
- Claustrum: `ck auth bind` (§8); sink-level tombstone refusal (defence in depth, after the
  manifest-lock PR). The instrument re-point is **done and self-actuating** (2026-09-05 05:55Z):
  sealer and latch-watch read the tombstone predicate per tick, so nothing on that side is a
  flip-time action.
- **Operator runbook for this deployment (not a runtime dependency; §13.3):** (a) probe the
  **installed** `ck-auth` binary for the typed tombstone refusal **with a real-material positive
  control in the same run**, and assert zero audit-chain movement (an announcement is a trigger to
  run the probe, not evidence); (b) send the exact flip time (UTC + epoch) to the Claustrum seat
  **before** the write, and treat the handover as observed only when they return the `CUSTODY_MODE`
  edge from the sealer log and the `EXCLUDE_NOW ''` edge from latch-watch with timestamps. This is
  how this operator verifies the live flip; the command's own completion contract is §13.3.
- Manifest-lock contract: case-folding aliasing of nonces on case-insensitive volumes (raised with
  the contract owner, unruled).

## 12. Unresolved questions (design, not implementation)

These are open. The maintainer's ruling (2026-09-05) is that they need a source-backed answer before
any code; this section records them so they are not lost in the handoff.

### 12.1 The host-write race is not closed

Everything the barrier fences is ours: config, sidecar, manifest, per-account refresh locks.
`auth.json` is the host's, and OpenCode's `Auth.set` (the login callback,
`provider/auth.ts:188-221` → `auth/index.ts:73-80`) takes no lock we can share. So for main:

- a login can complete between the barrier's step 4 re-read and `client.auth.set`, and the fresh
  family is **overwritten by the tombstone**. Re-reading a matching fingerprint immediately before
  the write is still check-then-write; it shrinks the window to the width of one RPC, it does not
  remove it.
- restoring a tombstone into an absent slot (the former C9 install, now withdrawn) had the same race
  in the other direction, plus the torn-read amplifier below: a login can land in the "absent" slot
  between the factory's read and its write, and the read itself may have been torn.

The fingerprint is therefore **crash reconciliation only** (§4).

**Source of the race** (OpenCode `339536bc22`, `packages/opencode/src/auth/index.ts:73-89`):
`Auth.set` is `all()` → spread → `writeJson`. No lock, no compare-and-set, no expected-value check,
and the write itself is **not atomic**: `util/filesystem.ts:61-84` is an in-place `writeFile`, not
temp-and-rename, so a concurrent reader can observe a partial file. No write event exists, and the
loader is memoised init-once. There is nothing at the host to honour; the gap is tracked upstream as
[anomalyco/opencode#46128](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/46128) ("auth.json writes
are unlocked whole-file rewrites", open). Consequences beyond our slot:

- it rewrites the **whole file**, so two concurrent `set`s on *different* keys are last-writer-wins.
  A tombstone write on `anthropic` can clobber a concurrent `openai` login and vice versa; any
  plugin that writes its slot during another plugin's login loses one of them. This is a property
  of the host's auth store, not of custody.
- a fresh login that lands in the window is **lost** if the tombstone overwrites it (ordering B).
  Whether that also kills the vault's family is **unverified for both providers**: coexisting
  lineages have been observed only for two *refreshes* of one grant, and a fresh login mints a
  *new grant*, a different operation; an earlier claim that OpenAI lineages survive a fresh login
  was withdrawn by its author on that basis. If a fresh login invalidates the prior lineage,
  ordering B leaves the account dark; if not, the cost is one re-login. The probe that settles it
  (refresh `R_old` once, complete a fresh login, refresh `R_old'` again) carries the hazard it
  measures on a vault-held account and is operator-gated. The fingerprint preserves the
  single-refresher invariant in both orderings; only losslessness differs. Either way the
  transition stays blocked (§13.1).
- **the torn-read amplifier turns a lost race into a wiped store.** `Auth.all()` is
  `readJson(file).pipe(Effect.orElseSucceed(() => ({})))` (`auth/index.ts:65`) over a non-atomic
  writer, so a read racing another writer's in-place `writeFile` can parse a truncated file and
  yield an **empty auth map**. Two consequences: (i) a single `client.auth.get(key) === undefined`
  is not evidence the slot is absent, it may be a torn read; (ii) any `Auth.set` issued from that
  state spreads `{}` and rewrites `auth.json` containing **only the writer's key**, destroying every
  other provider's credentials. A plugin that installs into an "absent" slot during another
  plugin's login can wipe the store, not merely lose the race.
- **`OPENCODE_AUTH_CONTENT` is a deterministic clobber, not a race.** A child process started with
  that variable (`workspace.ts:532-533`) reads auth from the env snapshot in preference to the file
  (`auth/index.ts:59-61`), and every `Auth.set` it performs rewrites the file from that snapshot,
  restoring pre-tombstone material for the child's whole lifetime. This is a **checkable
  precondition** (scan `/proc/*/environ` for the variable before the transition), which is what §8's
  "fail loudly" concretely means.

**Mitigations that do not need a host primitive** (candidates; none closes the cross-process case):
(1) a process-local mutex shared by the barrier and every plugin-owned login entry, the login
holding it until a `client.auth.get` readback observes the host's write, which closes the
same-process race because both sides are our code; (2) a post-write readback after each tombstone
write, so ordering A is detected in the same run rather than on the next boot; (3) the cross-process
residual (a login in another OpenCode window) **declared** in the transition's confirmation text,
never hidden; (4) a **convergent write** for the main-slot install, proposed by the Claustrum seat on
the #196 thread and buildable inside Claustrum's follow-up import tooling (verb pending: not in any
deployed build as of 2026-09-07) where the imported bytes
are already in hand: import first → write the tombstone → settle → re-read; a slot **byte-equal to
the imported material** means a clobber by an env-snapshot child (rewrite, bounded retries), while
**different real material** means a newer family landed (refuse loud, never overwrite). The residual
is detected, bounded, and loud, which is the most a host without a fence can give. Whether that
satisfies §13.1's "source-backed synchronisation" is the maintainer's call.

**What closes it** is small and belongs in OpenCode: a per-key compare-and-set,
`Auth.set(key, info, { expect })` rejecting when `current[key] ≠ expect`, or an advisory lock that
`set`/`remove` take. Not filed; a change to a third-party repo is the operator's and maintainer's
call.

### 12.2 A raced login versus "bindings clear only after verified login"

C2′ (`NEW_LOCAL_FAMILY_UNDER_CLAUSTRUM`) describes real material under custody that the barrier did
not classify: most plausibly a login that raced the transition. An earlier draft offered "exit to
`local`; the login stands" as one operator resolution. That contradicts §6/§8: the raced login did
not complete through **our** path with an in-process record, so under `local` it is L5
(`DARK_PENDING_VERIFIED_LOGIN`), not L1, and its binding does not clear. Either the verified-login
rule admits some evidence other than our in-process record (and then what, and how is it
distinguished from a restored backup, which is the case the rule exists for), or a raced login is
never allowed to stand and the only resolution is a fresh vault import.

**Resolution proposed (strictness), for the maintainer's ruling:** a login that landed outside the
plugin's own path (raced, restored backup, another process) is **never** verified. It lands L5; its
binding never auto-clears; the only exits are the plugin's own in-process verified login (new
family, clears) or `ck auth`. The rule exists to reject restored backups, and a raced login is
indistinguishable from one by content, so it gets the same treatment. The openai-auth port adopted
this. One sub-question stays open: whether L5 **serves** its access token until expiry (no refresh,
which still satisfies §13.2) or refuses as the table currently says; both are consistent with the
rulings, and the difference is availability versus caution on a credential the vault may have
rotated.

### 12.3 Smaller

- `OPENCODE_AUTH_CONTENT` (§8) makes the live `getAuth` re-read blind; "fail loudly" is stated, the
  detection point is not.
- The `enable` precondition under `claustrum` requires `USABLE`; whether a `REAUTH`-latched account
  may be enabled-but-dark (so it resumes without a second operator action after re-import) is
  unstated.

### 12.4 A cold main handle at boot holds warm fallbacks

`C|T|T|N` is a global verdict for a cold main handle at boot. It blocks a healthy, bound fallback even when the daemon is healthy and that fallback could serve. A latched main record is `C|T|T|V` with reauth status; today its route refuses that account rather than treating it as `N`. That describes current behavior, not a resolution of the cold-at-boot question.

Two directions remain open:

1. Keep the global refusal. The operator re-imports the main record before the next boot.
2. Serve fallbacks only. The main route returns a typed refusal while healthy fallbacks remain route-local, matching §5's fallback residency rule.

Unresolved for the cold-at-boot global-hold question. This document does not choose between these directions.
## 13. Implementation constraints (binding, from the 06:04Z go-ahead)

1. **The host-write race stays open and the unsafe transition stays BLOCKED.** A plugin main-slot
   write (`client.auth.set` of the tombstone) is not fenced against OpenCode's
   `Auth.set`, and plugin-side restoration into an absent slot is withdrawn outright (C9, §12.1).
   **What the command does today, under the block:** the plugin issues **no** main-slot write at
   all. Main's tombstone is written by the operator-driven vault import
   (the settled ownership of main import, verb pending: Claustrum follow-up; not in any deployed build as of 2026-09-07), and the barrier
   treats "main's slot already holds the recognise-set" as a **precondition**: at step 2, main
   classifies C1 only if the slot is already INERT; a REAL main slot is a typed refusal
   (`main is still local; onboard main into the vault with Claustrum's tooling first`) issued **before** step 3,
   so no mode write and no fallback commit happens (the barrier is all-or-nothing readiness).
   Consequently C2 (`RESUME_TAKEOVER`) applies to **fallbacks only**; a REAL main under
   `mode=claustrum` is refused as `TAKEOVER_INCOMPLETE_MAIN_REAL` in both fingerprint cases (no
   writes, inert), with the fingerprint still deciding the *classification* the refusal carries: a
   match is crash-left pre-commit material (C2), a mismatch or absence is
   `NEW_LOCAL_FAMILY_UNDER_CLAUSTRUM` (C2′). Same operator recovery; different diagnosis. When a source-backed synchronisation lands, the plugin-side write can be added
   behind that same precondition without changing any verdict. The command does not describe the
   fingerprint as a fix and does not weaken the invariant so a test passes. The fallback half of the
   barrier (fenced by our own locks), the serving path, and every independent task proceed.
   Regression coverage must **demonstrate the exact interleaving** (a host write
   between our re-read and our write, for both the tombstone install and absent-slot restoration)
   and assert that the transition is blocked; a passing fingerprint-only test is not proof of
   safety and must not be presented as one.
2. **Returning to `local` never makes a surviving binding's material refreshable by itself.** A
   raced or restored local credential under a live binding stays inert until a login verified
   through our own path clears the binding (L4/L5). No wording anywhere says a raced login "stands".
3. **Production correctness is separate from local operational observation.** The Claustrum-seat
   steps in §11 (sending a flip time, receiving sealer/latch-watch log edges) are an **operator
   runbook** for this deployment, not a runtime dependency of the command and not part of its
   completion contract. Completion is machine-checkable inside the plugin and, under §13.1,
   contains no plugin write to main's slot: for **main**, the slot re-reads as the recognise-set
   (the precondition, verified, not a write of ours); for each **fallback**, its sidecar row re-reads
   as the recognise-set tombstone (our write); for every account, `credential.get` through the binding
   succeeds, status reports `CUSTODY_SERVE`, and zero local refresh attempts are observed.

Regression coverage required by the go-ahead: host-write interleaving (blocked, both directions),
crash/resume, concurrent mode changes, verified-login binding clearance.
