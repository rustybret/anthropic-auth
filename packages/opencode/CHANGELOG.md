# @cortexkit/opencode-anthropic-auth

This package is a CortexKit-maintained fork of the original `@ex-machina/opencode-anthropic-auth` plugin. Entries below this note are inherited from the upstream package history.

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- Add automatic Fable content-filter recovery: transparently route the session through Opus 4.8 for a 10-response recovery window, prewarm Fable after each successful Opus response, and return to Fable without changing the selected session model.
- Preserve both model caches during recovery by warming Fable with the OAuth account that served the refused request and retaining an Opus standby cache bridge when healthy Fable turns move the previous Opus boundary outside Anthropic's 20-block lookback.
- Show session-specific recovery status in the TUI sidebar and send safe transition notices in OpenCode Desktop without spending quota or creating an extra provider response.

## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- Expose Claude Sonnet 5 in the Pi Anthropic provider catalog, completing its existing adaptive-thinking request support.

### Patch Changes

- Preserve empty model-scoped quota arrays through account-state loading, runtime-state merges, and sidebar normalization so a fresh quota response can clear a previously stored scoped window.
- Omit unavailable 5h/7d placeholders from collapsed quota summaries when only a scoped model window is present.
- Update OpenTUI Solid, OpenCode SDK, Biome, and generated project documentation.

Thanks to [@iceteaSA](https://github.com/iceteaSA) for the scoped-quota persistence fixes and [@nodnarbnitram](https://github.com/nodnarbnitram) for the Pi Sonnet 5 catalog contribution.

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- Add model-scoped OAuth quota support for Anthropic weekly scoped limits such as Fable, including sidebar/quota-summary display and model-aware OAuth fallback routing. Fable scoped exhaustion can route Fable requests to an OAuth fallback while other models continue using the main account.
- Add per-model scoped killswitch thresholds so matching scoped quota windows can hard-block an account without poisoning routing for other models.

### Patch Changes

- Fix same-label fallback OAuth re-login state merging so fresh credentials clear stale reauth/quota errors and invalidate old quota cache entries.
- Keep CacheKeep tracking on OAuth fallback routes and prewarm with the same OAuth account that served the cached request.
- Shorten the Fable scoped quota sidebar label to `Fa` and preserve scoped killswitch thresholds in the TUI edit modal.

Thanks to [@iceteaSA](https://github.com/iceteaSA) for the scoped killswitch contribution.

## 1.12.2

### Patch Changes

- Update OpenCode SDK/plugin dependencies.

## 1.12.1

### Patch Changes

- Request visible summarized adaptive thinking for Claude Sonnet 5, while preserving explicit disabled-thinking requests and canonicalizing them to the accepted bare disabled shape.

Thanks to [@iceteaSA](https://github.com/iceteaSA) for the Sonnet 5 adaptive-thinking fix.

## 1.12.0

### Minor Changes

- Handle Anthropic auth slash commands with an Effect-compatible `204 No Content` response shape, avoiding logged plugin errors in current OpenCode while keeping the legacy sentinel fallback for older hosts.

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `/claude-account` interactive TUI dialogs for fallback account management, including list, enable, disable, reorder, remove, API-key route setup, and OAuth fallback login helpers.
- Add `/claude-logging` command/dialog support for persisted log levels.
- Add CacheKeep per-warm cost logging and an opt-in CacheKeep subagent toggle.

### Patch Changes

- Harden account storage, refresh locks, sidebar state, and RPC discovery against lost updates, stale-lock races, malformed state files, and multi-session port collisions.
- Load runtime auth state even when the editable config file is absent, so credentials and fallback state remain visible after config cleanup.
- Improve account cleanup and re-login UX by clearing removed fallback runtime state, showing dead fallback accounts that need re-login, and preserving clearer OAuth account labels.
- Treat Claude quota endpoint `403` responses as account/org-policy auth failures without arming quota backoff or OAuth refresh backoff.
- Update OpenCode, OpenTUI, Miniflare, Biome, GitHub Actions, and related development dependencies.

Thanks to [@iceteaSA](https://github.com/iceteaSA) for the account/logging parity work and account-management fixes, [@jonmast](https://github.com/jonmast) for the runtime-state load fix, and [@eddieparc](https://github.com/eddieparc) for reporting and proposing the quota `403` backoff boundary fix.

## 1.10.3

### Patch Changes

- Keep `fallback-first` routing on usable fallback accounts when another process is already refreshing fallback quota, preventing a broken primary OAuth refresh backoff from aborting requests while fallback quota is still passing.
- Keep the TUI preferences watcher stable even when unrelated tests or integrations temporarily override global timers.

## 1.10.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix `ReadableStream is locked` failures after detecting Anthropic streaming rate-limit errors when no fallback route can serve the request, returning a replayable inspected response instead of reusing the consumed stream.

## 1.10.1

### Patch Changes

- Stabilize `/claude-cache hybrid` system cache anchors when OpenCode leaves plugin-added system instructions split across multiple blocks, preserving the canonical merged tail before placing the Anthropic cache breakpoint.

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Add interactive TUI command dialogs for Anthropic auth commands, backed by a localhost-only authenticated RPC bridge so sidebar actions can configure routing, cache, quota, relay, and related settings without text-only command replies.

### Patch Changes

- Mark transient Anthropic SSE server errors inside HTTP 200 streams as retryable connection-reset-style failures so OpenCode can use its normal auto-retry flow instead of surfacing them as non-retryable unknown errors.

Thanks to [@iceteaSA](https://github.com/iceteaSA) for the interactive TUI command modal contribution.

## 1.9.4

### Patch Changes

- Align Claude OAuth request fingerprints with captured Claude Code 2.1.177 interactive CLI traffic, including the CLI identity string, user agent, billing `cc_entrypoint=cli`, and beta header ordering.
- Remove unavailable `context-1m` and `effort` betas from Claude Code OAuth requests, add the captured thinking token count beta, and keep redacted thinking disabled by design.
- Match captured OAuth login/refresh details more closely with the updated axios-style user agent, accept header, refresh scope, and Claude Max authorize URL.

Thanks to [@iceteaSA](https://github.com/iceteaSA) for the Claude Code MITM capture and fingerprint alignment.

## 1.9.3

### Patch Changes

- Keep sidebar quota display stable during concurrent quota refreshes by re-seeding from the latest runtime state and avoiding stale quota writes from older plugin instances.
- Dump direct Anthropic requests when `/claude-dump on` is enabled, including redacted request metadata. Relay requests continue to include relay metadata.
- Strip OpenAI encrypted reasoning payloads before converting stored history to Anthropic `thinking` blocks.
- Add configurable TUI preferences via `tui-preferences.jsonc`, persisted sidebar collapse state, shared `forceToTop` ordering helpers, and quota pacing/runout projections in the sidebar.
- Update OpenCode, OpenTUI, Miniflare, and related development dependencies.

Thanks to [@iceteaSA](https://github.com/iceteaSA) for the TUI preferences and quota pacing contributions.

## 1.9.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix `/claude-cache hybrid` anchors for Magic Context requests where stable project context and session history are merged into `messages[0]`, preserving cache breakpoints on the first two prefix blocks instead of the volatile tail.

## 1.9.1

### Patch Changes

- Request summarized adaptive thinking for Claude Fable 5 and Mythos 5 so OpenCode can display readable reasoning summaries instead of blank signed-thinking blocks.
- Add opt-in structural SSE diagnostics under `OPENCODE_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_PERF=1`, counting Anthropic event, block, and delta types without logging response text or tool input content.

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a `costZeroing.enabled` opt-out so advanced users can show Anthropic model pricing for OAuth sessions instead of the default zero-cost subscription/quota display.

### Patch Changes

- Fix synthetic Claude Fable 5 and Mythos 5 catalog entries so `model.api.id` matches the selected model, ensuring the wire request sends Fable/Mythos rather than the cloned Opus fallback model.
- Coalesce WebSocket relay upstream SSE chunks before binary WebSocket sends, reducing tiny frame fragmentation while preserving response bytes exactly.
- Memoize repeated system-prompt sanitation work with a bounded byte-aware cache.

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- Add Claude Fable 5 and limited-access Claude Mythos 5 to the Anthropic provider catalog so OpenCode can select them before upstream catalog updates land.
- Add API-key fallback routes for Anthropic-compatible providers such as Kie, with strict fresh-quota exhaustion checks before spending API-key credits.
- Split editable config from runtime auth state so background refresh and quota writers cannot clobber user-managed settings.

### Patch Changes

- Normalize Fable/Mythos requests by removing top-level adaptive `thinking` and preserving `output_config.effort`, matching Anthropic's migration guidance.
- Show both 5-hour and 7-day quota windows in the collapsed sidebar active-account summary.
- Display Anthropic OAuth models as zero-cost through the provider model hook while preserving token accounting and API-key pricing.
- Bound relay/cachekeep/identity in-memory caches, propagate relay abort signals, and add opt-in request/relay/stream performance instrumentation under `OPENCODE_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_PERF=1`.

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Improve `/claude-cache hybrid` for Magic Context sessions whose stable `m[0]` and volatile `m[1]` history blocks are merged into one Anthropic user message: hybrid mode now anchors both the first and last cacheable block of `messages[0]` so stable leading history can remain cached when the trailing delta changes.
- Include a sanitized session/affinity segment in `/claude-dump` artifact filenames so dumps from different sessions are easier to find.

### Patch Changes

- Refresh current-token main quota in the sidebar without blocking `fallback-first` routing, avoiding a stale `checking…` display after main token rotation.
- Keep custom/future Claude billing version suffixes stable across date boundaries so the billing header does not rotate at midnight and unexpectedly bust prompt-cache prefixes.

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- Mark WebSocket relay stream-close failures as retryable connection resets so OpenCode can show its normal retry countdown instead of bailing on mid-stream relay disconnects.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `/claude-killswitch`, allowing requests to be hard-blocked or rerouted when main or fallback Claude quota drops below configured per-account thresholds.
- Add a collapsible quota sidebar view and opt-in quota refresh toasts controlled by `quota.showToasts`.

### Patch Changes

- Improve WebSocket relay recovery when a socket closes after upstream `response_start` but before any stream bytes reach OpenCode, and add clearer close diagnostics for mid-stream failures.
- Fix sidebar quota refreshes so async quota updates do not clobber the active account or show stale fallback quota state.
- Update OpenCode SDK/plugin, OpenTUI, and relay test dependencies.

Thanks to [@iceteaSA](https://github.com/iceteaSA) for the killswitch, quota toast, and sidebar contributions.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Add an OpenCode TUI sidebar for Claude quota, active route, relay transport, and cache status.
- Add persisted quota caching, quota API backoff, token-bound fallback quota state, and request-count-based quota refreshes.

### Patch Changes

- Strip trailing assistant messages from Anthropic request bodies to avoid Claude OAuth prefill `400` errors when a conversation does not end with a user message.
- Avoid placing `cache_control` on message objects in hybrid cache mode when the selected message has no cacheable content block.
- Invalidate fallback quota cache and quota backoff when a same-label fallback account is re-logged with a new token.
- Fix TUI package loading by exporting the source TUI entrypoint and including required sidebar state files in the package.
- Fix TUI sidebar state so it uses token-bound quota reads and reflects the actual active route.
- Canonicalize dropped AFT tool namespaces in Anthropic responses, so `safety`/`mcp_Safety` and other known AFT suffixes are mapped back to `aft_*` tool names.
- Reload relay config from the sidecar on each request so long-running OpenCode processes stop using stale HTTP/WebSocket settings.
- Reduce fallback OAuth refresh backoff log noise and improve WebSocket relay fallback diagnostics.
- Fix root `bun test` and CI workflow test commands.

Thanks to [@iceteaSA](https://github.com/iceteaSA) for the quota manager and TUI sidebar contributions.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `/claude-routing` with persisted `routing.mode` so OpenCode can switch between the default `main-first` routing and `fallback-first` routing without restarting.
- In `fallback-first` mode, usable sidecar fallback accounts are tried before the main account; if no fallback succeeds, the request falls back to the main account.

## 1.2.5

### Patch Changes

- Reuse cached fallback-account quota snapshots when transient quota probes are rate limited, so an account with known remaining quota can still be tried instead of falling back to an exhausted main account.
- Reuse fresh fallback-account quota snapshots during explicit quota checks and clear stale quota errors so transient quota-probe `429`s do not hide otherwise usable fallback account state.

## 1.2.4

### Patch Changes

- Serialize fallback-account OAuth refreshes across OpenCode processes so concurrent refresh attempts cannot reuse and invalidate a rotating refresh token.

## 1.2.3

### Patch Changes

- Align Claude OAuth token refresh with the live-tested PR #40 request shape: `https://platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token`, JSON payloads, and an `axios/1.13.6` User-Agent.
- Honor OAuth `Retry-After` responses and skip request-path refresh attempts while main-account backoff is active, reducing repeated refresh failures during Anthropic rate limits.

Thanks to [@iceteaSA](https://github.com/iceteaSA) for the OAuth refresh fixes in this release.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Refresh Claude OAuth tokens through `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/oauth/token`, matching the live-smoke-tested CLIProxyAPI JSON refresh path, after `platform.claude.com` repeatedly returned OAuth `429` during proactive refresh.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Bundle the OpenCode plugin runtime with Bun so published installs no longer depend on workspace-local source layout.

### Patch Changes

- Retry transient Claude OAuth refresh failures in the shared helper while keeping the OpenCode main-account refresh path single-sourced through its existing retry, backoff, and cross-process lock.
- Reduce redundant account-storage reads in fallback routing and quota selection paths.
- Harden relay optimistic-stream error handling and Worker request handling, including deferred KV state writes and a health response.
- Update development dependencies and release workflow actions; release CI now also runs the OpenCode e2e harness before publishing.

Thanks to [@iceteaSA](https://github.com/iceteaSA) for the batch of fallback, relay, and packaging improvements that went into this release.

## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Refresh Claude OAuth tokens earlier by treating `refresh.refreshBeforeExpiryMinutes` as a minimum 4-hour window, preventing transient OAuth `429` backoff from pushing retries past token expiry.
- Serialize main OpenCode OAuth refresh across concurrently running OpenCode processes with an atomic filesystem lock, avoiding multi-session refresh races against Anthropic's OAuth endpoint.

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Added `/claude-cachekeep` for hybrid Claude cache mode. It keeps in-memory clones of recently used rewritten requests and sends prewarm-safe `max_tokens: 0` calls during the configured local time window.
- Fixed OAuth refresh backoff after re-login by resetting retry severity when the refresh token rotates.
- Reduced hidden slash-command reply overhead by bounding OpenCode prompt-context lookup to the most recent 100 messages instead of hydrating the full session.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- Initial CortexKit release under `@cortexkit/opencode-anthropic-auth`, including multi-account fallback, quota-aware routing, Claude cache controls, final-body billing signing, and the optional user-owned Cloudflare relay.
