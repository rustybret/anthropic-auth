**Configuration:**
- `package.json` (root): Bun workspace root — workspace config, shared dev dependencies, root scripts

- `packages/opencode/src/fable-fallback.ts`: Per-session and source-model-family 10-response Opus 4.8 backstop state (recognizing context-window-qualified models like `[1m]`), source-model prewarming, and standby cache-anchor identity; used after unabsorbed server-policy refusals or exclusively under `OPENCODE_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_FALLBACK_MODE=legacy`
- `packages/opencode/src/prime-manager-registry.ts`: Process-wide registry that shares PrimeManager instances by account-storage identity and returns generation-fenced project-slot leases, preventing late predecessor disposal from releasing a reloaded successor
- `packages/opencode/src/request-policy.ts`: Internal killswitch block classification and user-facing request-policy messages kept outside the plugin entrypoint so OpenCode invokes only `AnthropicAuthPlugin`
- `packages/opencode/src/lane-start.ts`: Resolves the current prompt context, injects the exact synthetic lane-start marker, and correlates its message ID to one request through a bounded session-scoped tracker
- `packages/opencode/src/sidebar-state.ts`: Shared quota/routing, prime status, and session-keyed server/legacy safety fallback state file for TUI sidebar IPC, using cross-process `mkdir` directory locks, read-before-write routing preservation, and pre/post-rename ownership fences
- `packages/opencode/src/sanitize-memo.ts`: System prompt sanitization memoization LRU cache

- `packages/opencode/src/effort-history.ts`: Carries bounded Fable 5.1 effort transitions across OpenCode host lowering with stable checksum-bound user-boundary markers, a plan-bound current-user anchor, and a fixed-size request-plan header retained across same-message provider retries; accepts correlated tool-result continuations and ordered transitions merged onto one wire user boundary, retains bounded and revocable history for overwritten in-flight plans, folds exact-suffix-trimmed changes into the baseline only with an authenticated surviving anchor, strips internal state before dispatch, and fails locally on unprovable total marker loss or non-prefix correlation loss
- `packages/opencode/src/billing-lineage.ts`: Correlates user message prompt UUIDs and upstream Anthropic request IDs across tool turns via internal headers, excludes background and synthetic turns, tracks session sequence/generations, and commits valid `req_*` responses to feed `previousRequestId` into the billing header
- `packages/opencode/src/custody-mode.ts`: Scoped-only startup verdict and fail-closed mismatch classification
- `packages/opencode/src/custody-dimensions.ts`: Classification of scoped roster, main tombstone, and OAuth fallback dimensions
- `packages/opencode/src/tui-preferences.ts`: Comment-preserving JSONC preference reads/writes plus live reload through content-checked directory events and an independent polling fallback for missed events or `fs.watch` construction failures
- `packages/opencode/src/tui/command-dialogs.tsx`: Command modal dialog presentation and input formatting
- `packages/pi/src/commands.ts`: Pi slash command registration (`/claude-*`) and persistent setting handlers
- `packages/pi/src/paths.ts`: Pi-specific storage and config path resolution
- `packages/pi/src/convert.ts`: Pi-to-Anthropic request conversion, including ordered system prompt block flattening, session-stable Claude Code billing suffixes, same-origin thinking-signature replay, configurable Fable 5.1 compaction behavior, mid-conversation effort markers, redacted_thinking mapping, Pi documentation-prompt relocation, and four-slot cache breakpoint placement
- `packages/pi/src/transcript.ts`: Locally replays host system messages and tool changes rather than importing helpers absent from Oh My Pi's legacy SDK shim
- `packages/pi/src/effort-history.ts`: Rebuilds Fable 5.1 effort transitions from Pi's active branch and compaction-aware context entries (locally derived when buildContextEntries is absent)
- `packages/pi/src/stream.ts`: Pi provider streaming implementation, including preservation of Anthropic redacted-thinking blocks for later replay, request-resolved host tool names for SSE tool-call mapping, API-key route versioned URL composition, and safe custom header application

**Tests:**
- `packages/core/src/tests/`: Core-only unit tests (dump, killswitch, models, prime, quota surfaces, accounts persistence, custom headers, model remap, claustrum)
- `packages/opencode/src/tests/`: OpenCode unit and integration tests, including scoped Claustrum custody, billing lineage, a fail-closed network guard, and test-host filesystem/daemon isolation. `preload-sandbox.ts` initializes a disposable sandbox before `setup.ts` imports Core (whose logger/dump defaults are fixed at module load), then `setup.ts` restores account, sidebar, cache, RPC, dump, and daemon paths before/after tests so clearing a feature override cannot reach live state.
- `packages/pi/src/tests/`: Pi-specific tests (commands, convert, effort-history, index, stream)
- `packages/e2e-tests/tests/`: Process integration tests (tool prefix, quota header relay, temp directory hygiene, scoped custody, and Opus 5.5 structured output with and without the schema tool call)

## Naming Conventions

**Files:** Lowercase with hyphens for all TypeScript source files (`auth.ts`, `quota-manager.ts`, `fallback-account.ts`). Each module file exports a focused set of related functions/types.

**Directories:** Lowercase with hyphens for feature directories (`rpc/`, `tui/`, `e2e-tests/`). Tests are co-located in `tests/` subdirectories.

**Packages:** `@cortexkit/anthropic-auth-core` for the shared core, and `@cortexkit/<host>-anthropic-auth` for integrations (`opencode`, `pi`).

**Exports:** Core library re-exports all modules through a barrel (`packages/core/src/index.ts`). OpenCode and Pi packages import from core by name, not path.

## Where to Add New Code

**New shared feature (used by both OpenCode and Pi):** `packages/core/src/[feature].ts` — add the implementation, export it from `packages/core/src/index.ts`, then import it in the OpenCode plugin and/or Pi extension as needed.

**New OpenCode hook or fetch transform:** `packages/opencode/src/` — follow the pattern in `index.ts` for hook registration or `transform.ts` for pipeline steps. Add tests in `packages/opencode/src/tests/`.

**New menu action:** Extend Core's native menu model/executor and typed action values, then implement each action's host-specific storage calls, notifications and UI updates in OpenCode and Pi. The user-facing command remains `/claude`; add menu presentation rather than restoring separately registered `/claude-*` commands. Keep host-only transport/UI work out of Core's pure settings transforms.

**New TUI feature:** `packages/opencode/src/tui/` — add components as `.tsx` files using SolidJS + OpenTUI. Add RPC protocol types in `packages/opencode/src/rpc/protocol.ts` if the feature needs server-to-TUI IPC.

**New test:** Add `*.test.ts` under the owning package's test directory — `packages/core/src/tests/` for core-only tests, `packages/opencode/src/tests/` for OpenCode and shared-core integration tests, `packages/pi/src/tests/` for Pi-specific tests, and `packages/e2e-tests/tests/` for process-level integration tests.

**New script:** `scripts/` (for global analysis/development tools) or `packages/opencode/scripts/` (for TUI build/packaging validations and bundle checks) — use TypeScript (run with `bun`) or plain JavaScript. Reference `tsconfig.scripts.json` or `packages/opencode/tsconfig.scripts.json` for TypeScript compilation options.

**New CLI action:** Add a handler in `packages/opencode/src/cli.ts` using native account services or setup after quitting all OpenCode, LiteCode and Pi processes. No CLI path may reintroduce sidecar credential writers.

**New model spec:** `packages/core/src/models.ts` — add model ID, pricing, context window, and max output tokens constants. If it needs special request handling, update `packages/opencode/src/transform.ts` (e.g., Fable/Mythos, Sonnet 5/5.5, or Opus 5/5.5 adaptive thinking normalization).

**Fork & Arcus Conventions:**
- Never publish packages from this repo to npm or recreate upstream release scripts (`scripts/release.sh`, `scripts/wait-release.sh`).
- Distribution is driven via Arcus v2: canonical releases are built, signed, and landed on `rustybret/arcus` via Cloudhome BuildKit CI (`arcus-release-upload`) and promoted by `uc-studio` in `arcus-blessed-plugins.json`.
- Upstream sync is driven via `bun run fork-sync`, which automatically installs dependencies before build verification and preserves fork-specific files.
