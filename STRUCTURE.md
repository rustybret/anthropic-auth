## Naming Conventions

**Files:** Lowercase with hyphens for all TypeScript source files (`auth.ts`, `quota-manager.ts`, `fallback-account.ts`). Each module file exports a focused set of related functions/types.

**Directories:** Lowercase with hyphens for feature directories (`rpc/`, `tui/`, `e2e-tests/`). Tests are co-located in `tests/` subdirectories.

**Packages:** `@cortexkit/anthropic-auth-core` for the shared core, and `@cortexkit/<host>-anthropic-auth` for integrations (`opencode`, `pi`).

**Exports:** Core library re-exports all modules through a barrel (`packages/core/src/index.ts`). OpenCode and Pi packages import from core by name, not path.

## Where to Add New Code

**New shared feature (used by both OpenCode and Pi):** `packages/core/src/[feature].ts` — add the implementation, export it from `packages/core/src/index.ts`, then import it in the OpenCode plugin and/or Pi extension as needed.

**New OpenCode hook or fetch transform:** `packages/opencode/src/` — follow the pattern in `index.ts` for hook registration or `transform.ts` for pipeline steps. Add tests in `packages/opencode/src/tests/`.

**New slash command:** Register the command name in `packages/core/src/constants.ts` (or a dedicated module), implement execution logic in core (shared) or per-package (if platform-specific), add it to the shared `COMMAND_MODAL_NAMES` tuple in `packages/opencode/src/rpc/protocol.ts`, register its `template` and `description` in the `config` hook, and handle it exhaustively in `buildDialogPayload` in `packages/opencode/src/index.ts`. The tuple derives the closed `CommandModalName` type and the `command.execute.before` interception list; `index.test.ts` asserts that the config-hook command set exactly matches it, while the exhaustive payload branch makes new unhandled modal names fail type-checking. An interactive palette check still verifies that the running host surfaces the command. For Pi, add the command in `packages/pi/src/commands.ts`. If the command owns a background scheduler, keep its manager in core and adopt one process-wide manager through a keyed registry in the host package; persist user opt-in separately from runtime counters when the command spans processes, as `/claude-prime` does.

**New TUI feature:** `packages/opencode/src/tui/` — add components as `.tsx` files using SolidJS + OpenTUI. Add RPC protocol types in `packages/opencode/src/rpc/protocol.ts` if the feature needs server-to-TUI IPC.

**New test:** Add `*.test.ts` under the owning package's test directory — `packages/core/src/tests/` for core-only tests, `packages/opencode/src/tests/` for OpenCode and shared-core integration tests, `packages/pi/src/tests/` for Pi-specific tests, and `packages/e2e-tests/tests/` for process-level integration tests.

**New script:** `scripts/` (for global analysis/development tools) or `packages/opencode/scripts/` (for TUI build/packaging validations) — use TypeScript (run with `bun`) or plain JavaScript. Reference `tsconfig.scripts.json` or `packages/opencode/tsconfig.scripts.json` for TypeScript compilation options.

**New CLI command:** `packages/opencode/src/cli.ts` — add the subcommand handler following the `login`/`list`/`api add`/`relay setup` pattern.

**New model spec:** `packages/core/src/models.ts` — add model ID, pricing, context window, and max output tokens constants. If it needs special request handling, update `packages/opencode/src/transform.ts` (e.g., Fable/Mythos, Sonnet 5, or Opus 5 adaptive thinking normalization).

**Shared utilities used across packages:** Extend `packages/core/src/` rather than duplicating between opencode and pi packages.
