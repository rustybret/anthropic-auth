# Auditor Notes

Guidance for future audits of intentional tradeoffs in this repository.

## Relay/WebSocket routing

- **Per-affinity WebSocket serialization is intentional.** The relay protocol keeps one ordered request stream per `x-session-affinity` so patch bases, revisions, and Worker checkpoint state remain consistent. Do not flag the per-affinity queue as a bug unless proposing a protocol-level design with independent per-request state or resumable streams.
- **Patch mismatch recovery can require `full_sync`.** When the local patch base does not match Worker state, the safe recovery path is to retry as `full_sync` before sending upstream. This costs upload bytes but prevents sending reconstructed-corrupt bodies to Anthropic.
- **Fallback routes are intentionally sequential.** Sending multiple model requests in parallel can double-spend OAuth quota or API-key credits and can produce duplicate assistant/tool streams. Do not recommend parallel fallback dispatch without an explicit cancellation/billing design.
- **WebSocket requests currently use fixed internal ready/response timeouts.** HTTP relay now propagates request abort signals. WebSocket abort/resume support is a larger protocol concern and should be evaluated with the Durable Object/resumable-stream design, not as a small local patch.

## Cache and request transforms

- **Pi cache-marker behavior intentionally does not yet mirror OpenCode hybrid anchoring.** OpenCode receives already-shaped provider request JSON and has Magic Context-specific anchor logic; Pi builds Anthropic bodies from Pi messages. Treat Pi cache parity as a product/design task rather than a drive-by perf fix.
- **CCH/signing and cache rewrites parse/stringify request bodies.** This is expected because signing must cover the final serialized body and cache markers are JSON-structural. Optimizations should preserve exact wire-body semantics and be backed by benchmarks.
- **Relay patch creation is linear in body size.** This is currently acceptable relative to JSON serialization/signing and network upload costs. Replacing it should be justified by measurements and must preserve hash-gated reconstruction.
- **Total loss of Fable 5.1 effort markers and the current-user anchor remains fail-closed (#237/#242).** A resolved request-plan header alone cannot prove that the retained wire history is an exact suffix; a retained earlier user/assistant pair with all marker text stripped is a concrete counterexample. An anchored full prefix trim already folds safely. Missing-all refusals log only bounded shape and hashed plan metadata, never prompt text or marker bytes; accepting an unanchored trim needs independent proof of the surviving boundary, not a count check.
- **Opus 5.5 structured output cannot be forced with `tool_choice: any/tool`.** Anthropic rejects those values on Opus 5.5, including OpenCode's `required` setting for JSON-schema output. The request keeps the StructuredOutput tool and system instruction but removes only the unsupported forced choice; OpenCode validates a returned tool call against the schema and reports `StructuredOutputError` when the model completes without it. This avoids a universal 400 without claiming that every request is guaranteed to produce structured output. A real isolated OpenCode tool round-trip and plain-text negative test cover both outcomes.

## Quota and fallback policy

- **API-key fallback routes are deliberately stricter than OAuth fallback accounts.** They may only run after confirmed main OAuth quota exhaustion: fresh token-bound 0% quota, or main OAuth 429/streaming rate-limit followed by a live quota check confirming 0%. Low-but-nonzero quota, stale cached quota, unconfirmed 429s, 401, and 403 must not trigger API-key routes.
- **Killswitch quota refresh can block request routing.** This is intentional for safety when the user enables killswitch behavior. Any performance optimization must preserve fail-closed semantics.

## Logging

- **The temp-file logger uses buffered synchronous writes.** It flushes at a 500ms cadence or 50-line buffer to avoid losing diagnostics on crashes while keeping normal request-path overhead low. Do not flag as a correctness issue without latency measurements showing it is material.

## Sticky-balanced routing

- **Session affinity intentionally outranks moment-to-moment quota ranking.** Once assigned, a session remains on its OAuth account across transient transport/provider/quota-probe failures and relative quota changes so its large prompt cache is not rewritten on another account.
- **A confirmed five-hour exhaustion does not migrate when reset is within 15 minutes.** The route returns `Retry-After` and remains assigned; longer 5h exhaustion, 7d/model-scoped exhaustion, killswitch blocks, removed/disabled accounts, and permanent re-login failures may migrate.
- **API-key routes are not candidates for quota-balanced first assignment.** Their existing confirmed-main-exhaustion gate remains authoritative.

## CI test-count floor gate

- **COUNT compares with the branch's own declared floor, even if it exceeds the merge target's floor.** Raising a floor is an assertion that the branch already has at least that many passing tests. A measured count below the newly raised floor must fail rather than silently accepting a false assertion merely because it exceeds the older target floor.
- **UNCHECKED is distinct from FAIL but deliberately blocks CI and release.** A missing merge target or unverified measurement cannot be treated as a green test-count check. The verdict and exit code explain the cause; `continue-on-error` would turn an inability to verify the ratchet into a bypass.
- **Only Core, OpenCode, and Pi unit tests have count floors.** Process-level E2E and the real Pi host round-trip remain separately required workflow steps; their pass/fail status is not claimed by the unit-count verdict. The gate runs the three unit suites once in place of the old `bun run test` step, not in addition to it.
- **Direct pushes to `main` remain allowed; PR checks alone cannot enforce a monotone floor.** The release job binds its test pass to the checked-out version tag and compares floor values to the immediately preceding release tag (not `HEAD^`), requiring an explicit from/to marker and reason for any reduction. A stale branch, missing post-bootstrap floor document, tag/version mismatch, or incomparable measurement stamp blocks publication. The only floorless historical release is `v1.23.0`; the first floor-bearing release compares to the explicit Core 290 / OpenCode 1672 / Pi 140 baseline verified on clean CI run 35908244749, never to zero. This guards publication, **not** direct pushes or untagged `main` changes; mandatory up-to-date checks would require a separate branch ruleset decision.

## Shipped TUI compiler dependency

- **OpenTUI pins a low-severity Babel advisory with no untrusted compilation path in this package.** `@opentui/solid@0.5.11` depends on exactly `@babel/core@7.28.0`; the newest checked release as of 2026-09-24, 0.5.12, retains that pin. `npm audit --omit=dev` on published OpenCode 1.23.0 reports one low finding ([GHSA-4x5r-pxfx-6jf8](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4x5r-pxfx-6jf8), fixed in Babel 7.29.6). The advisory requires attacker-controlled source code passed into Babel, readable compiled output, and knowledge of the target source-map path; GitHub explicitly states trusted-source compilation is unaffected. Our `build-tui.ts` compiles only its fixed list of checked-in source files, and the older-host raw TUI fallback imports only shipped TSX. Model prompts, tool output, config text, and request bodies are not compilation inputs. A root workspace override would not change the exact transitive dependency in users' npm installs. Reassess when OpenTUI updates its pin or if a TUI build path starts compiling user-controlled source; do not mistake a passing workspace-only override for a consumer fix.
